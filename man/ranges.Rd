\title{Defines vector as range}
\usage{
ranges(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{first element}

\item{y}{second element}
}
\value{
\code{c(x, y)}, but with the "range" class
}
\description{
Redefines the class of a vector as "range"
}
\note{
This function was created to be used as an element in the \code{N} argument of \code{cluster_gen}. The name was chosen to avoid conflict with \code{base::range()}.

\code{ranges()} should always be used within a \code{list()}. Inserting a "range" vector inside a common vector (\code{c()}) will result in a common vector. For example, \code{c(3, ranges(8, 10))} is the same as \code{c(3, 8, 10)}, because when faced with conflicting classes in the same element, R will resolve to the simpler case ("numeric", in this case). An easier way to understand this concept is by checking \code{class(c(3, "a"))} is "character", meaning the number 3 was devolved into a character "3".
