\usage{
booklet_sample(
  n_subj,
  book_item_design,
  book_prob = NULL,
  resample = FALSE,
  e = 0.1,
  iter = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_subj}{an integer, the number of subjects (test takers).}

\item{book_item_design}{a data frame containing the items that belong to each
booklet with booklets as columns and booklet item numbers as rows.  See 'Details'.}

\item{book_prob}{a vector of probability weights for obtaining the booklets being sampled.
The default equally weights all books.}

\item{resample}{logical indicating if booklets should be re-sampled to minimize differences.
Can only be used when \code{book_prob = NULL}.}

\item{e}{a number between 0 and 1 exclusive, re-sampling stopping criteria,
the difference between the most sampled and least sampled booklets.}

\item{iter}{an integer defining the number of iterations to reach e.}
}
\description{
\code{booklet_sample} randomly assigns test booklets to test takers.
}
\section{Details}{

If using \code{booklet_sample} in tandem with \code{booklet_design}, \code{book_item_design}
is the the first element of the returned list of \code{block_design}.
