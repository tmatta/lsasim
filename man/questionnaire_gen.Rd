\arguments{
\item{n_obs}{number of observations to generate.}

\item{cat_prop}{list of cumulative proportions for each item. If \code{theta
  = TRUE}, the first element of \code{cat_prop} must be a scalar 1, which
corresponds to the \code{theta}.}

\item{n_vars}{total number of variables in the questionnaire, including the
continuous and the discrete covariates (\eqn{X} and \eqn{W}, respectively),
as well as the latent trait (\eqn{Y}, which is equivalent to \eqn{\theta}).}

\item{n_X}{number of continuous background variables. If not provided, a
random number of continuous variables will be generated.}

\item{n_W}{either a scalar corresponding to the number of categorical
background variables or a list of scalars representing the number of
categories for each categorical variable. If not provided, a random number
of categorical variables will be generated.}

\item{cor_matrix}{latent correlation matrix. The first row/column corresponds
to the latent trait (\eqn{Y}). The other rows/columns correspond to the
continuous (\eqn{X} or \eqn{Z}) or the discrete (\eqn{W}) background
variables, in the same order as \code{cat_prop}.}

\item{cov_matrix}{latent covariance matrix, formatted as \code{cor_matrix}.}

\item{c_mean}{is a vector of population means for each continuous variable
(\eqn{Y} and \eqn{X}). Defaults to 0.}

\item{c_sd}{is a vector of population standard deviations for each continuous
variable  (\eqn{Y} and \eqn{X}). Defaults to 1.}

\item{theta}{if \code{TRUE}, the first continuous variable will be labeled
'theta'. Otherwise, it will be labeled 'q1'.}

\item{family}{distribution of the background variables. Can be NULL (default)
or 'gaussian'.}

\item{full_output}{if \code{TRUE}, output will be a list containing the
questionnaire data as well as several objects that might be of interest for
further analysis of the data.}

\item{verbose}{if \code{FALSE}, output messages will be suppressed (useful for
simulations). Defaults to \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
By default, the function returns a \code{data.frame} object where the
first column ("subject") is a \eqn{1,\ldots,n} ordered list of the \eqn{n}
observations and the other columns correspond to the questionnaire answers.
If \code{theta = TRUE}, the first column after "subject" will be the latent
variable \eqn{\theta}; in any case, the continuous variables always come
before the categorical ones.

If \code{full_output = TRUE}, the output will be a list containing the
following objects:

\item{bg}{a data frame containing the background questionnaire answers
(i.e., the same object as described above).}

\item{c_mean}{identical to the input argument of the same name. Read the
Details section for more information.}

\item{c_sd}{identical to the input argument of the same name. Read the
Details section for more information.}

\item{cat_prop}{identical to the input argument of the same name. Read the
Details section for more information.}

\item{cat_prop_W_p}{a list containing the probabilities for each category
of the categorical variables (\code{cat_prop_W} contains the cumulative
probabilities).}

\item{cor_matrix}{identical to the input argument of the same name. Read
the Details section for more information.}

\item{cov_matrix}{identical to the input argument of the same name. Read
the Details section for more information.}

\item{family}{identical to the input argument of the same name.}

\item{n_obs}{identical to the input argument of the same name.}

\item{n_tot}{named vector containing the number of total variables, the
number of continuous background variables (i.e., the total number of
background variables except \eqn{\theta}) and the number of categorical
variables.}

\item{n_W}{vector containing the number of categorical variables.}

\item{n_X}{vector containing the number of continuous variables (except
\eqn{\theta}).}

\item{sd_YXW}{vector with the standard deviations of all the variables}

\item{sd_YXZ}{vector containing the standard deviations of \eqn{\theta},
the background continuous variables (\eqn{X}) and the Normally-distributed
variables \eqn{Z} which will generate the background categorical variables
(\eqn{W}).}

\item{theta}{identical to the input argument of the same name.}

\item{var_W}{list containing the variances of the categorical variables.}

\item{var_YX}{list containing the variances of the continuous variables
(including \eqn{\theta})}

\item{linear_regression}{This list is printed only if \code{theta = TRUE},
\code{family = "gaussian"} and \code{full_output = TRUE}. It contains one vector
named \code{betas} and one tabled named \code{cov_YXW}. The former displays the true
linear regression coefficients of \eqn{theta} on the background
questionnaire answers; the latter contains the covariance matrix between
all these variables.}

\description{
Creates a data frame of discrete and continuous variables based on several
arguments.

\details{
In essence, this function begins by checking the validity of the
arguments provided and randomly generating those that are not. Then, it
will call one of two internal functions,
\code{questionnaire_gen_polychoric} or \code{questionnaire_gen_family}. The
former corresponds to the exact functionality of questionnaire_gen on
lsasim 1.0.1, where the polychoric correlations are used to generate the
background questionnaire data. If \code{family != NULL}, however,
\code{questionnaire_gen_family} is called to generate data based on a joint
probability distribution. Additionally, if \code{full_output == TRUE}, the
external function \code{beta_gen} is called to generate the correlation
coefficients based on the true covariance matrix. The latter argument also
changes the class of the output of this function.

What follows are some notes on the input parameters.

\code{cat_prop} is a list where \code{length(cat_prop)} is the number of
items to be generated.  Each element of the list is a vector containing the
marginal cumulative proportions for each category, summing to 1.  For
continuous items, the associated element in the list should be 1.

\code{cor_matrix} and \code{cov_matrix} are the correlation and covariance
matrices that are the same size as \code{length(cat_prop)}.  The
correlations related to the correlation between variables on the latent
scale.

\code{c_mean and c_sd} are each vectors whose length is equal to the number
of continuous variables as specified by \code{cat_prop}.  The default is to
keep the continuous variables with mean zero and standard deviation of one.

\code{theta} is a logical indicator that determines if the first continuous
item should be labeled \emph{theta}. If \code{theta == TRUE} but there are
no continuous variables generated, a random number of background variables
will be generated.

If \code{cat_prop} is a named list, those names will be used as variable
names for the returned \code{data.frame}.  Generic names will be provided
to the variables if \code{cat_prop} is not named.

As an alternative to providing \code{cat_prop}, the user can call this
function by specifying the total number of variables using \code{n_vars} or
the specific number of continuous and categorical variables through
\code{n_X} and \code{n_W}. All three arguments should be provided as
scalars; \code{n_W} may also be provided as a list, where each element
contains the number of categories for one background variable.
Alternatively, \code{n_W} may be provided as a one-element list, in which
case it will be interpreted as all the categorical variables having the
same number of categories.

If \code{family == "gaussian"}, the questionnaire will be generated
assuming that all the variables are jointly-distributed as a multivariate
normal. The default behavior is \code{family == NULL}, where the data is
generated using the polychoric correlation matrix, with no distributional
assumptions.

When data is generated using the Gaussian distribution, the matrices
provided correspond to the relations between the latent variable
\eqn{\theta}, the continuous covariates \eqn{X} and the continuous
covariates---\eqn{Z ~ N(0, 1)}---that will later be discretized into
categorical covariates \eqn{W}. That is why there will be a difference
between labels and lengths between \code{cov_matrix} and \code{vcov_YXW}.
For more information, check the references cited later in this document.
}
\note{
If \code{family == NULL}, the number of levels for each categorical
variables will be determined by the number of categories observed in the
generated data. This means it might be smaller than the number of
categories determined by \code{cat_prop}, which is more likely to happen
with small values of \code{n_obs}. If \code{family == "gaussian"}, however,
the number of levels for the categorical variables will always be
equivalent to the number of possible categories, even if they are not
observed in the data.

It is important to note that all arguments directly related to variable
parameters (e.g. \code{cat_prop}, \code{cov_matrix}, \code{cor_matrix}, \code{c_mean}, \code{c_sd})
have the following order: Y, X, W (missing variables are skipped). This
must be kept in mind when using real-life data as input to
\code{questionnaire_gen}, as the input might need to be reordered to fit the
expectations of the function.

By definition, the expected order of the variables is \eqn{theta},
followed by \eqn{X} and then \eqn{W}. The reference category of the
categorical variables \eqn{W} is always the first one.

For very small means/sigmas (e.g. 0.005) and multiple levels, estimates
may have differing levels of accuracy (e.g. school level estimates will not
be as accurate as the student levels ones). In general, one should expect
naturally worse estimation on higher hierarchical setups.
