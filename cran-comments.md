Dear CRAN Team,
this is a resubmission of package 'lsasim'. I have added the following changes:

* Improved output of `cluster_gen()`
* Improved documentation of `cluster_gen()` (issue #52)
* Improved Markdown formatting of documentation everywhere
* Allow simultaneous specification of `cat_prop` and `rho` on `cluster_gen()` (issue #51)

Please upload to CRAN.
Best, Waldir
